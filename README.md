<h3 align="center">⚠️ Project in Romanian</h3>

<p>First, I examined some descriptive statistics about the database. It is divided into episodes and seasons, so that analyses can be done both on the basis of quotes and on the basis of seasons. 
<br/>Also of importance for this project can be refining the most important words in the dialogue of the characters, analyzing the sentiments by seasons, classifying the words into positive or negative, and highlighting the negative and positive characters based on the sentiments obtained. 
<br/>Finally, I performed topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).</p>
